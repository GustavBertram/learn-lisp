;;; Exercise 1.10.
;; The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's
;; function:

(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

; Looks like it's the Tarjan variant of the Ackermann function. (https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Ackermann_function)

;; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above.
;; Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the
;; procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n.
;; For example, (k n) computes 5n^2. 

(define (f n) (A 0 n)) ; 2n

(define (g n) (A 1 n)) ; 2^n where n>0

(define (h n) (A 2 n)) ; 2^^n (tetration), where n>0 and ^^ is Knuth up arrows

; (A 3 n) computes 2^^^n (pentation)

; I think this version of Ackermann's function calculates 2\uparrow^n (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation)
; This seems to confirm that idea: https://github.com/sarabander/p2pu-sicp/blob/master/1.2/Ex1.10.pdf 

(define (k n) (* 5 n n)) ; 5n^2
