;;; Exercise 1.9.
;; Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive
;; integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1,
;; and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (++ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (++ (dec a) (inc b))))

;; Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
;; procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

; First function is recursive, due to the delayed inc.
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)

; Second function is iterative, due to not having any delayed operations.

(++ 3 6)
(++ 2 7)
(++ 1 8)
(++ 0 9)
